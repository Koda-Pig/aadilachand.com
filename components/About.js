            impossible intelligent beings another world Orion&apos;s sword

            Orion&apos;s sword bits of moving fluff a still more glorious dawn
            awaits inconspicuous motes of rock and gas citizens of distant
            epochs a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam and billions upon
            billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions
            upon billions.
